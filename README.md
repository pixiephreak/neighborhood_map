## Udacity Front End Web Developer final project. Create a single page app from scratch using knockout, google APIS, and ajax requests

### Step-by-step detailed instruction on how to open the app locally:
* Download the entire assets folder and the index.html file to a directory.
* Open index.html in any browser or run it on a local serve.
* For grading purposes, the Yelp and Google Maps API keys are not made secret. They can be replaced with your own if desired.
